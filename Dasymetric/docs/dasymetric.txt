Dasymetric Mapping

Terminology: 
  auxillary data (aux) = the raster data across which the totals will be dispersed (ie landcover)
  variable of interest (voi) = The variable we want to disperse (ie population). Stored in an attribute table, aggregated by polygon.

1. Rasterize the vector layer representing the variable of interest. The cellsize and extent should be the exact same as the auxillary data

  [ArcGIS]
  spatial analyst > options > extent = vector
  spatial analyst > options > cell size = raster
  spatial analyst > convert > features to raster (use the variable of interest as the output column)

2. Combine the variable raster with the auxillary data. First the variable raster must be integer to avoid having too many unique values.

  [ArcInfo GRID]
  voi2 = int(voi) 
  combine = combine(voi2,aux)

3. Export the combine table to dbf
  
  [ArcInfo]
  infodbase combine.vat combine.dbf

4. Create a table with a row for each auxillary class and it's relative weighting (must add up to 1). Use Excel and export as DBF4.

5. Run the model which distributes the variable across the landscape and outputs a raster.
