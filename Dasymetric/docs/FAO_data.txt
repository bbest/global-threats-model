FAO data:

Get country codes from http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/form?version=ext&collection=FBS&Domain=FBS&language=EN&servlet=1&axis=area&xsl=areareflist

Remove the regions and save as csv (remove year headers since dbfs can't have numeric header names)

Join to world data with a shapefile (using country names) 

Change names to match fao names and codes then rejoin

Dissolve based on code and fao_name

Select out those areas with non-zero codes




TFC9302 -> 1st three are variable code, next two are first year, last two are last year \                                            (value is inclusive average of years)

To calculate 10 year averages:
----
 Remove all zeros that were not true zeros. If there were zeros mixed in with greater values, they were assumed to be null. 

 We keep averages even if n=1 since that consititutes the best guess. 

 If a countries' average is zero where it clearly should have a value (ie China has a pesticide average of 0!), then we use a logistical regression between fertilizer and pesticide for similar countries to estimate the unknown.

 - subset countries wth both pesticide and fetilizer values (n=133) => ArcMap, select, export
 - develop regression eq for subset. => >

 - use the regression to calculate values for countries missing pesticide. => ArcMap, select, calculate

223 countries total ....

134 countries have fert, pest, and gdp
 45 countries have fert and gdp but no pest
 41 countries have gdp but no fert or pest
  3 countries have no data
  

 - What can we say about the remaining 45 countries?
    - some are tiny island countries of little overall significance to overall study
    - some may have no agriculture thus no fertilizer/pesticide use
    - some may not have reported any fert/pesticide use
