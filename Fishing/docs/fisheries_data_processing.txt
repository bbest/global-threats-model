Global Fisheries Data

Global fish catch data is first classified into fishing methods, associated with point locations, converted to a raster grid, then adjusted by primary productivity of the surrounding are. This technique gives us a ratio of fish catch to productivity - a useful measure of fishing pressure for each method.
Overview

The fish catch data was aggregated by 5 different fishing methods:

   1. Palagic, high bycatch
   2. Palagic, low bycatch
   3. Demersal, destructive
   4. Demersal, non-destructive, high bycatch
   5. Demersal, non-destructive, low bycatch


Each catch rate is associated with a particular point location. It is then rasterized and normalized by primary productivity to give an indicator of global fishing pressure.

Methods

    * Export the the point locations table from Access to dbf files
    * Add XY data in ArcMap to convert the location table into a point dataset. Save as shapefile.
    * select for each catch type and export a seperate dbf
    * join each dbf to the cell locations (SEQ from the point layer -> CELL from the catch data) and output the 5 joined shapefiles.
    * Rasterize each of the joined shapefiles using the catch rate column (CR) for the value.
    * Resample the fisheries data to the same cellsize and extent and the productivty data
    * Grid algebra to adjust for productivity. The focalmean ensures that local variations in production are not as important as the average productivity of the general area.

 The unit conversion factor ensures that the output grids ensure that the units are tons of fish catch per tons of carbon production annually.

units on fish catch: millions of tons fish / km^2 * 1km^2/ 1,000,000 m^2 = tons fish/ m^2

units on procuctivity: grams Carbon/ m^2 * 1 ton carbon/ 907184.74 g carbon  = tons carbon / 907184.74 m^2

fish catch / productivity : tons fish / m^2 * 907184.74 m^2 / tons carbon = tons fish / tons carbon
